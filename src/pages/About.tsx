      question: "What is a Nice Guy Recovery Coach?",
      answer: "A Nice Guy Recovery Coach specializes in helping men identify and break free from people-pleasing patterns, approval addiction, and codependent behaviors. Unlike general life coaching, this work focuses specifically on the patterns described in Nice Guy Syndrome — including covert contracts, conflict avoidance, and suppressed anger.",
    },
    {
      question: "How does your coaching work?",
      answer: "Michael's coaching is delivered through structured online programs with video lessons, exercises, and frameworks you can apply immediately. Each program targets a specific area of Nice Guy recovery — from boundaries and communication to dating and self-worth. Programs are self-paced with lifetime access.",
    },
    {
      question: "What results do clients typically see?",
      answer: "Clients typically report being able to set boundaries without guilt, communicate directly instead of hinting, stop building covert contracts, handle others' displeasure without caving, and build relationships based on authenticity rather than performance.",
    },
    {
      question: "Do you offer one-on-one coaching?",
      answer: "Yes. In addition to the self-paced programs, Michael offers one-on-one coaching sessions for men who want personalized guidance. You can book a free discovery session to discuss your situation and see which option is the best fit.",

                <p>
                  For most of my life, I was a textbook Nice Guy. I said yes when I meant no. I performed for approval. I built covert contracts in every relationship — and then resented people when they didn't hold up their end of a deal they never agreed to.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The turning point came when I realized that my "niceness" wasn't generosity — it was a survival strategy I'd built as a kid to avoid conflict and earn love. Once I saw the pattern, I couldn't unsee it.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I spent years doing the deep work: examining my parental relationships, learning to tolerate displeasure, setting boundaries I'd never set before, and building an identity based on my actual values — not the ones I thought would make people like me.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Now I coach other men through the same process. Not with vague platitudes about "just be yourself," but with a structured framework that creates real, lasting change.
