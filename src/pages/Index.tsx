      question: "What is Nice Guy Syndrome?",
      answer: "Nice Guy Syndrome is a set of behavioral patterns where men suppress their own needs, avoid conflict, and seek approval from others in an attempt to be liked. It often stems from childhood conditioning and leads to resentment, passive-aggressive behavior, and unfulfilling relationships.",
    },
    {
      question: "How do I know if I'm a Nice Guy?",
      answer: "Common signs include people-pleasing, difficulty saying no, avoiding conflict at all costs, building covert contracts (doing things expecting something in return without saying so), suppressing anger, and feeling resentful when your efforts aren't reciprocated.",
    },
    {
      question: "What is approval addiction?",
      answer: "Approval addiction is the compulsive need to seek validation and approval from others. It drives people-pleasing behavior, fear of rejection, and the inability to make decisions based on your own values rather than what others might think of you.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can Nice Guy patterns actually change?",
      answer: "Yes. Nice Guy patterns are learned behaviors, not personality traits. With the right framework and consistent practice, men can break the cycle of approval-seeking, build authentic boundaries, and develop genuine confidence. Most clients see significant changes within 90 days.",
    },
    {
      question: "What makes this different from reading self-help books?",
      answer: "Books provide information but not transformation. Most men read No More Mr Nice Guy and understand the concepts, but nothing changes because reading alone doesn't rewire deeply ingrained patterns. These courses provide structured exercises, accountability, and a proven framework that creates lasting behavioral change.",
    },
    {
      question: "How long does Nice Guy recovery take?",
      answer: "Most men start seeing meaningful shifts within 4-8 weeks of consistent work. Full recovery from deeply ingrained patterns typically takes 3-6 months. The courses are self-paced with lifetime access, so you can work at whatever speed suits you.",
